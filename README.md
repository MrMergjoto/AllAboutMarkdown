### Summary
Markdown was initially created in 2004 as a perl preprocessor of plain text files or text data.&nbsp; Markdown is used by many websites to allow users to easily format text for readability, although several of the larger websites that have Markdown style text formatting capabilities have implemented custom features specific for the website users' needs.&nbsp; [RFC 7763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7763) describes Markdown as a "writing format" in contrast with HTML being a "publishing format".

### GFM - Github Flavored Markdown
One of the most useful and popular sites that has a Markdown-style implementation is github.com.&nbsp; From the github.com page describing the [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), the different Markdown elements that are available are:
**Headings**, **Text Styling**, **Quoting Text**, **Quoting Code**, **Links**, **Page Section Links**, **Relative Links**, and **Lists**.&nbsp; There are also several github.com specific Markdown level text preprocessing such as **Task Lists**, **User and Team Mentions**, **Issue Tracker Entry References**, **Pull Request References**, **Emoji**.&nbsp; The way that github.com handles paragraphs and line breaks using an empty newline to start a new paragraph, as well as the '\\' backslash character escape code for showing the '\\', '\`', '\*', '\_', '\{\}', '\[\]', '\(\)', '\#', '\+', '\-', '\.', and '\!' characters.
